World-Layoffs Data Cleaning and Exploration using SQL 

Project Description: Transferring raw data into a staging table called staging_table and preapring it to clean. Using CTE, window functions and other queries
                      to index data and remove any existing duplicates,extra whitespaces or format issues. Thereon, removal of NULLS wherever necesaary
                      and replacing NULL(text) with null type. Deletipn and updation of table by removing the null rows where insights weren't possible.
                      Filling in the rows with details of lay-offs wherever possible (likeAirbnb,etc).
                      Data-Exploration completed using SQl join and other relavant queries as attached in the Exploration file

📊World-Layoffs Visualization Dashboard
An interactive visual tool built to analyse the impact of layoffs on varied industries and companies globally.

📄Project Description: Visualization Dashboard is designed to analyze lay-off patterns across various industries, yearly
providing an intuitive interface for tracking the companies that shut down completely, industries impacted the most which years had the maximum impact. 
Built using PowerBI, this dashboard transforms cleaned data into actionable insights!

👩‍💻Technology Stack: The Dashboard visualization used the following technology for its completion-
💻PowerBI - Main data visualization platform to visualize the Sql format of data for report creation
🔗Git-bash- For version control and clear record of changes in the project files, locally and remotely on gitHub 
📟Data Analysis Expressions(DAX)- To calculate the Maximum layoffs grouped by industry, company year-on-year, Maximum layoff by whcih company during thr Covid aftermath                        

DataSource:
Sources: gitHub repo

🎯Goals- To study the lay-off pattern globally, across industries and companies and conclude the most impacted ones yearly or otherwise
👩‍💼Business Impact:To answer these pressing questions, I leveraged the power of PowerBI. This dashboard enables any viewer to: 
  🔹 Visualize which company and industries had maximum layoffs during 2020-23 period 
  🔹 Identify trends of layoffs across years  
  🔹 Which companies lay-off their entire workforce during the Covid aftermath

Through this project, I deepened my expertise in ETL process, data exploration using SQL and data visualization, git and github, honing my ability to transform raw lay-offs data into meaningful, actionable insights!
